# Analyzing Boston Marathon Data: Are women catching men?

### Topic
This project examines Boston Marathon race times from 2001-2017. The first Boston Marathon was held in 1897. However, women were not permitted to compete until 1972. Since then, both men's and women's race times have improved drastically due to imporovements in running technology and knowledge of the sport. The goal of my project was to examine whether women's Boston Marathon times are improving disproportionately to men's times, given that women have only begun competing recently. 

### Findings 
I found that women's race times do seem to be improving faster than men's times are improving. 

### Data sources 
I compiled data from 3 different data sources, which all scraped data from the Boston Athletic Association website (baa.org). Here are the links to the 3 GitHub repositories that I used for my project:
